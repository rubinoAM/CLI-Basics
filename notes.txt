grep — Searches a specific file or set of files to see if a given string of text exists, and if it does, tells you where the text exists in those files.
This command is extremely flexible (e.g. use wildcards to search all files of a given type) and particularly useful for programmers (to find specific lines of code).

locate — Searches the entire system for files or directories that match the search query, then outputs the absolute paths for each match.
By default, it only searches in directories for which you have permissions. This is the simplest and fastest way to find a file.

kill/killall — You can use kill to end a process according to its process ID (often used in conjunction with the ps command) whereas you can use killall to end all processes whose names match your query.
